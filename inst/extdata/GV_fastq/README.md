# *Attention*
Since the original fastq format file is over 100m, it is compressed into rar format and users are advised to uncompress it first after installing PolyAtailor package.
## Get the .rar format file path with the following command
fastqfile <- system.file("extdata", "./GV_fastq/PAIso_GV1.rar", package = "PolyAtailor", mustWork = TRUE)
