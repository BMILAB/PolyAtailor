#' @description PolyAtailor is a user-friendly R package for measuring poly(A) tail length from NGS-based short-read and PacBio-based long-read sequencing data. Core functions of Tail_map and Tail_scan provided in PolyAtailor can profile tails with or without using a reference genome. PolyAtailor can identify multiple tails in a read, with detailed information of tail type, tail position, tail length and tail sequence. PolyAtailor also integrates rich functions for downstream analyses and visualization of poly(A) tails and poly(A) sites.
#' @details This package contains most of the functions required in poly(A) tail
#'   research, including tail recognition from sequence, tail length
#'   calculation, non-A base recognition and quantifying tail, PA site
#'   determination, tail length difference significance detection, basic data
#'   statistics, and so on.
