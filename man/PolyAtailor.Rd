\description{
This package provides functions for identifying and quantifying
  poly(A) tails of full-length sequencing data from BAM files as well as
  difference significance detection.
}
\details{
This package contains most of the functions required in poly(A) tail
  research, including tail recognition from sequence, tail length
  calculation, non-A base recognition and quantifying tail, PA site
  determination, tail length difference significance detection, basic data
  statistics, and so on.
