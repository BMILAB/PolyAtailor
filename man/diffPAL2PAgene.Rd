\usage{
gff <- parseGenomeAnnotation(TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38.knownGene)
diffPAL2PAgenes <- diffPALgene(PAdf1,al1,gff)
}
\arguments{
\item{PAdf}{A dataframe of PA infomation.}

\item{PALdf}{A dataframe that contains the length information of all reads
tails.}

\item{gff}{Genome annotation stored in a GFF/GTF file or a TXDB R object can
be used for annotating PACs. Please refer to movAPA for details.}

\item{d}{distance to group nearby PACds, default is 24 nt.}
}
\value{
The function returns a dataframe of result. The result data frame
  contains 7 column contents, the first column is geneID, and the second and
  third columns are the median tail lengths under different conditions. The
  remaining four columns are p-values calculated by different difference
  significance test methods, each column corresponds to a difference
  significance test method, in which "lose" or "NAN" means that for some
  reason (probably too little data) this method has not been able to
  calculate the exact p-values.
}
\description{
Analysis of significant difference in tail length of genes with
  two PAs.
}
\details{
This function was used to analyze the data for genes with two PA
  sites showing significant differences in tail length between the two PA
  sites.The function will use four difference significance test methods to
  find all genes with significant difference in tail length in the provided
  data and make a UpSet graph.
